# Panorama Template
Stripped-down, modernized version of the [American Panorama template](https://github.com/americanpanorama/panorama-template). This template/boilerplate offers a starting point for creating applications that use components from [Stamen](http://stamen.com)'s [Panorama toolkit](https://github.com/stamen/panorama). It is built using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](redux.js.org), and [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router), but uses only a minimal subset of offerings from each. While designed to be used with [Panorama toolkit](https://github.com/stamen/panorama), at it's heart it's really just a React project template, and can be used with or without the Panorama components.

#### N.B.
_[Stamen](http://stamen.com)'s [Panorama toolkit](https://github.com/stamen/panorama) is not yet published on npm. Until it is, either `npm link` to a local copy of Stamen Panorama, or just remove it from `package.json` if you don't need it. --@ericsoco 2016.03.29_

## Setup
#### 1. Set up required Node version 

Ensure that your Node version matches that present in `.nvmrc`.
[`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is the easiest way to do this on Mac, [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) on Windows. Installation instructions are in each of those links.

To use `nvm` to switch Node versions:

```bash
$ nvm install
Found '/Users/seth/src/americanpanorama/panorama-template/.nvmrc' with version <5.9.1>
######################################################################## 100.0%
Now using node v5.9.1 (npm v2.11.3)
```

NOTE: you'll need to run `nvm install` (or `nvm use`) in each shell instance.

#### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Note: **version > 2.7.0 is required** to install scoped packages, such as `@panorama/toolkit`. Instructions for updating npm are [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#updating-npm).

Load required **npm** modules.

```bash
npm install
```



## Develop
To run locally:

```bash
npm start
```
Open browser to [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)


##Deploy
**To use development code**: Copy the [build directory](./build) to your server, but for **production** you will want to run:

```npm run dist```

This will create a `dist` directory. Move this directory to your server.

Both directories are all **static files**, so no special server requirements needed.



## Structure

The template is written in ES6, and compiled down to ES5 via [Babel](https://babeljs.io). All of the application setup happens in [`main.jsx`](./src/main.jsx).

#### Redux
A single Redux [store](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Store.html) and [action creator](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html) are instantiated there, and passed down into the application. They are passed through the React component tree, available as props (in a component, as `this.props.store` and `this.props.actions`, respectively). This pattern allows the application to be used in a server-rendering context as well, keeping application state separate for each session. [Reducers](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html) live in [`reducers.js`](./src/reducers.js), and the action creator exists within [`actions.js`](./src/actions.js).


#### Router configuration
React Router acts as the primary framework within which applications using this template are built. The router configuration (mapping of paths to views) exists within the React `render()` call in [`main.jsx`](./src/main.jsx). Router views are generally defined within [`./src/views/`](./src/views/), while local components (those not imported from Panorama) live within [`./src/components/`](./src/components/). This runs parallel to the concept of ["container and presentational" components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.mcwowhpa9).

#### Sass variables
The template uses [`gulp-json-sass`](https://github.com/rbalicki2/gulp-json-sass) to allow variables to be shared across Sass and JavaScript. Variables added to [`variables.json`](./scss/variables.json) can be `import`ed into JavaScript files. The project build compiles them into Sass variables, which are imported from [`variables-derived.scss`](./scss/variables-derived.scss). Examples of this exist within [`App.jsx`](./src/views/App.jsx) and [`_layout.scss`](./scss/_layout.scss).
